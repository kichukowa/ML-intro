### Games Rating System

##### games_rating_prediction.ipynb

The Games Rating System is based on Property Pricing Predictor. Keep in mind that synthetic data is being generated (original data could not be used for personal uses) - manually randomizing it results in negative model scores!

##### generate_games_data.py

Random data for each feature are generated distributing weighted chances among values.

##### synthetic_games_data.csv

Some important features for evaluating the rating of a game are:

- Theme
- Lines
- Hit Rate
- Volatility

##### tool_example.png

Here you can find some example for possible tool, which can be provided to Game Designers, who can easily check different combinations of mechanics and their possible outcome on the market.

Vew Details option could:
- open an interactive plot where more precise changes could be tested;
- save the information for further usage.

### Personal Daily Productivity Rating

Project in progress

Currently it generates random data which consists of hours for different personal daily targets. All of the hours in each sample must be not greater than 14! In the future similar data could be tracked in order to make models and predict productivity even based on other features like season, healthy condition and so on...
